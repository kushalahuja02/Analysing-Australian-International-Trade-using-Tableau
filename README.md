# Analysing Australian International Trade

## Overview
This project focuses on the visualization of the Australian International Trade dataset. The objective is to understand and present data patterns and stories through various visualization techniques. The dataset, spanning from 1988 to 2021, includes detailed import and export information across multiple industries and commodities.

## Dataset Description
- **Period**: 1988-2021
- **Categories**: 10 main categories with 67 sub-categories
- **Content**: Data on productivity, resource usage, import and export in various industries

## Data Preparation
Data preparation involved creating new sheets for different analysis types, including 'Ratio' (Statistical Pattern) and 'Changes' (Analytical Pattern), and a combined sheet for import and export data comparison.

## Visualization Techniques Used
1. **Time Series Charts**: To visualize statistical patterns in import and export across categories.
2. **Interactive Charts**: For exploring import and export percentages in various categories.
3. **Dashboards**: Combining multiple graphical data types for easy interpretation and comparison.
4. **Storyboards**: Presenting complex data in an interactive and story-like format.

## Key Insights
- Significant increase in both total imports (about 600%) and exports (about 750%) over the years.
- Major surges in export in 2014 due to free trade agreements with China, Japan, and Korea.
- Increase in imports in 2003 due to a rise in the Australian Currency Rate.
- Machinery and transport equipment as major contributors to imports.
- Varied trends in exports across different categories.

## Tools Used
- Tableau for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- MS-Excel for Data Preprocessing
- Various statistical techniques for data analysis.

## Conclusion
The project successfully leverages data visualization techniques to provide meaningful insights into the Australian International Trade data. It highlights trends and patterns crucial for understanding trade dynamics over the years.

## How to Use
- This project includes a pre-designed Tableau workbook that allows for in-depth analysis and visualization of property market data. Here's how to use it:

Download the Workbook: After cloning this repository, navigate to the 'tableau' directory. Here, you'll find the Tableau workbook file (with a .twbx extension).

Open Tableau: Launch Tableau or Tableau Public on your computer. If you don't have Tableau installed, you can download it from the official Tableau website or use Tableau Public.

Load the Workbook: In Tableau, select 'Open' and navigate to the downloaded Tableau workbook file. Open the file to load the workbook.

Interacting with Visualizations

Explore the Visualizations: The workbook contains various pre-built visualizations and dashboards. Explore these by clicking on different tabs within the workbook.

Filter and Drill-down: Use the interactive features such as filters and drill-down options to explore different aspects of the data. These tools allow for a customized view and deeper analysis.
